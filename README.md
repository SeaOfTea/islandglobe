# A DirectX 11 Snow globe
Overview
-
This is the source code for the graphics portfolio module (Real time graphics) for my fourth year at the University of Hull. Created using DirectX 11 API  using the C++ programming language. Featuring a range of lighting techniques and programmable shaders (HLSL)

Installation and Compilation
------------
Unfortunately I have not been successful in being able to compile this project, which leaves me very sad. It also appears that I did not save the last compiled binaries. So unless someone can give me a hand installing a lot of the deprecated DirectX 11 headers, for instance d3dx11.h etc. then it looks like I won't be able to get this working again.
If you can get this working with Windows 10 please submit a pull request!

The code is uploaded here for your reference. 

The code is mostly within the BaseProject/ directory.
