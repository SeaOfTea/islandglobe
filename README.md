# A DirectX 11 Snow globe
Overview
-
This is the source code for the graphics portfolio module (Real time graphics) for my fourth year at the University of Hull. Created using DirectX 11 API  using the C++ programming language. Featuring a range of lighting techniques and programmable shaders (HLSL)

The different lighting techniques emulate different seasons within the snowglobe. Leaves regrow in the Spring, leaves burn off in the heat in the Summer, mist appears in Autumn, and the water freezes in the Winter.

Other various techniques can be controlled, like the camera, wireframe and selection of lighting model.

Particle effects for sea spray are shown at the edges of the beach. (in retrospective I now dislike this effect)

Installation and Compilation
------------
Unfortunately I have not been successful in being able to compile this project, which leaves me very sad. It also appears that I did not save the last compiled binaries. So unless someone can give me a hand installing a lot of the deprecated DirectX 11 headers, for instance d3dx11.h etc. then it looks like I won't be able to get this working again.
If you can get this working with Windows 10 please submit a pull request!

The code is uploaded here for your reference. 

The code is mostly within the BaseProject/ directory.
